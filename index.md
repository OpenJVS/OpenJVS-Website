OpenJVS is an emulator for JVS Arcade IO boards which are used in many arcade systems to this day.

## Requirements

OpenJVS requires a USB RS485 dongle to communicate, and supports the following hardware:

| Platform                        | Status      | Sense Line Required |
|---------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Naomi 1                         | Working     | No                  |
| Naomi 2                         | Working     | Yes                 |
| Triforce                        | Mostly      | Yes                 |
| Chihiro                         | Working     | Yes                 |
| Lindbergh                       | Working     | Yes                 |
| Ringedge                        | No          |                     |
| Namco System 23 (Time Crisis 2) | Working     | Yes                 |
| Namco System 256                | Working     | Yes                 |
| Taito Type X+                   | Working     | Yes                 |
| Taito Type X2                   | Working     | Yes                 |

On games that require a sense line, the following has to be wired up:

```

|          GND   (BLACK) |-------------| GND           |                 |                        |
| ARCADE   A+    (GREEN) |-------------| A+  RS485 USB |-----------------| USB  RASPBERRY PI > 1  |
|          B-    (WHITE) |-------------| B-            |                 |                        |
|                        |                                               |                        |
|          SENSE (RED)   |----------+------------------------------------| GPIO 12                |
                                    |
                                    +---- (1kOhm Resistor or 4 Signal Dioes) ---- GND
```

A 1KOhm resistor or 4 signal diodes are known to work properly, the purpose of these is to create a 2.5 volt drop.

A list of RS485 dongles and comments are below:

- FTDI - STRONGLY RECCOMEND!
- CP2102 - Worked for me, but a lot of people are having issues. I would generally reccomend not getting one, as I beleive a lot are fake.
- Other - Don't get them (unless you want to try it yourself).

## Installation and Running

To install OpenJVS follow the instructions below to install the required packages and make the program.

```
sudo apt install git cmake
git clone https://github.com/OpenJVS/OpenJVS
cd OpenJVS
make
```

To run locally (from inside the root directory):

```
sudo ./build/openjvs [optional outside mapping name]
```

To install for globally and run (from inside the root directory):

```
sudo make install
sudo openjvs [optional outside mapping name]
```

All input devices are disabled by default and must be enabled explicitly, to see what devices are available type:

```
sudo openjvs --list
```

You can then enable and disable the devices by running:

```
# To enable
sudo openjvs --enable sony-playstation-r-3-controller

# To disable
sudo openjvs --disable sony-playstation-r-3-controller
```

Each new device is seen as a new player. For example if you plug 2 playstation controllers in, they will be mapped to PLAYER 1 and PLAYER 2. This means you should disable controllers you don't want to use, as they will take up player space.

## Mapping

The new mapping system is based on a two stage mapping process. The first stage will map your device to the controller seen below. The second stage will map the controller seen below to an actual game on an arcade system. This means that when you want to change controller, you only have to create one map file for your new controller, and likewise if you want to change game you only have to make one map file for your new game.

To create mapping you should become familiar with the program _evtest_ which can be installed with `sudo apt install evtest`. When you run it with `sudo evtest` it will show you all of the input devices you have connected, and if you select one it will list their capabilities and show you the input events they are producing when you press buttons.

### Real to Virtual Controller Mapping

Files for mapping your own controller to this virtual controller live in `/etc/openjvs/devices/` and should be named as the same name the controller comes up in when you run `sudo evtest` with the spaces replaced with `-` symbols.

The file consists of multiple lines with a FROM and TO mapping seperated with a space like below.

Note extra modifiers can be used on analogue channels:

- `REVERSE` can be added to the end of a line to reverse the direction of the input
- `SENSITIVITY 1.9` can be used to multiply the sensitivity of the devices analogue axis.

```
# Example Mapping File
# Author: Bobby Dilley

# Map the button section
# <FROM> <TO>
BTN_SOUTH CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_A
BTN_NORTH CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_C

# Map the analogue section
ABS_X CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_X
ABS_Y CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_Y REVERSE
ABS_Z CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_R REVERSE SENSITIVITY 1.5
ABS_RZ CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_L SENSITIVITY 0.9


# Map a HAT controller
ABS_HAT0X CONTROLLER_BUTTON_LEFT CONTROLLER_BUTTON_RIGHT
```

As above you can map the HAT controls which are sometimes used for DPADS. This should take controller button outputs on a single line. This can map any analogue channel into a digital one so analogue hats as well as thumb sticks can be converted into digitals!

FROM keywords are selected from the list of linux input event keywords. These are the same as the ones shown when you run `sudo evtest`. TO keywords are selected from the pre defined virtual controller mapping keywords list. Below is the virtual controller that the mapping is based upon, along with the mapping keywords used to reference this controller.

### Virtual Controller to Game Mapping

Files for mapping your own controller to this virtual controller live in `/etc/openjvs/games/` and should be named either by their function such as `generic-driving` or by a specific game name `outrun`.

This file will be selected using the `DEFAULT_MAPPING` config keyword, or by a parameter passed to the program `sudo openjvs outrun2`.

The file consists of multiple lines with a `CONTROLLER_INPUT CONTROLLER_PLAYER ARCADE_INPUT ARCADE_PLAYER` mapping as shown below. Note `REVERSE` can be added to the end of a line to reverse the direction of the input.
Note a secondary `BUTTON_*` can be added to the end of the line as a secondary output which will be enabled with the first. This allows the emulating of H shifters in games like Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.

```
# Example Mapping File
# Author: Bobby Dilley

# Map the button section
# <CONTROLLER_INPUT> <CONTROLLER_PLAYER> <ARCADE_INPUT> <ARCADE_PLAYER>
CONTROLLER_BUTTON_A CONTROLLER_1 BUTTON_1 PLAYER_1
CONTROLLER_BUTTON_B CONTROLLER_1 BUTTON_2 PLAYER_1

# Player Two
CONTROLLER_BUTTON_A CONTROLLER_2 BUTTON_1 PLAYER_2
CONTROLLER_BUTTON_B CONTROLLER_2 BUTTON_2 PLAYER_2

# Map the analogue section
CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_X ANALOGUE_0
CONTROLLER_ANALOGUE_Y ANALOGUE_1

```

The list of ARCADE_INPUT keywords are listed below:

```
MAPPING KEYWORD
---------------
BUTTON_TEST,
BUTTON_TILT,
BUTTON_START,
BUTTON_SERVICE,
BUTTON_UP,
BUTTON_DOWN,
BUTTON_LEFT,
BUTTON_RIGHT,
BUTTON_1,
BUTTON_2,
BUTTON_3,
BUTTON_4,
BUTTON_5,
BUTTON_6,
BUTTON_7,
BUTTON_8,
BUTTON_9,
BUTTON_10,
ANALOGUE_1,
ANALOGUE_2,
ANALOGUE_3,
ANALOGUE_4,
ANALOGUE_5,
ANALOGUE_6,
ROTARY_1,
ROTARY_2,
ROTARY_3,
ROTARY_4,
ROTARY_5,
ROTARY_6,
```

Other mapping files can be included, so for example if a game is almost exactly the same as a generic mapping with one small difference, the generic mapping can be included and the one small difference added.

```
# Example Outrun 2 Mapping File
# Author: Bobby Dilley

# Set the IO to emulate
EMULATE SEGA_TYPE_3

# Include the generic driving file
INCLUDE generic-driving

# Make the additions
CONTROLLER_BUTTON_RIGHT_BUMPER CONTROLLER_1 BUTTON_UP PLAYER_2
CONTROLLER_BUTTON_LEFT_BUMPER CONTROLLER_1 BUTTON_DOWN PLAYER_2

```

As well as this the IO that should be emulated can be specified in the map file with the `EMULATE` keyword, these IOs are created in `input.h` and are from the following list.

```
IO TO EMULATE
-------------
SEGA_TYPE_3_IO
NAMCO_JYU_IO
NAMCO_V185_IO
```
